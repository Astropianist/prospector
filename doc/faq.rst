How do I add filter transmission curves?
--------

Many projects use particular filter systems that are not general or wideley used.
It is easy to add a set of custom filter curves.
Filter projections are handeled by the `sedpy <https:github.com/bd-j/sedpy>`_ code.
See the FAQ there <https:github.com/bd-j/sedpy/blob/master/docs/faq.rst> for detailed instructions on adding filter cirves.
