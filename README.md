use Bayesian MCMC to constrain the linear combination of spectral
components that are present in a galaxy using Hybrid Monte Carlo.

Additionally, conduct principled inference of stellar population
properties from a combination of spectral and photometric data,
reducing the need for standard spectrophotometric calibration procedures.
