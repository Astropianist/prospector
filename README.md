use Bayesian MCMC to constrain the linear combination of spectral components that are present in a galaxy

usage example: recover_angst_lowres.py -- given the parameters in the pars dictionary at the beginning of the file, this piece of code will return some diagnostics and plots of the MCMC results for a given galaxy.  Assumes a single metallicity and no dust (for now).

relies on emcee.
