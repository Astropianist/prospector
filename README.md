BSFH
=====
Conduct principled inference of stellar population
properties from photometric and/or spectroscopic data.  BSFH allows
you to:

* Combine photometric and spectroscopic data rigorously using a flexible
 spectroscopic calibration model.

* Infer high-dimensional stellar population properties using
 parameteric SFHs (with ensemble MCMC sampling)

* Use spectra to constrain the linear combination of spectral
components that are present in a galaxy (e.g. non-parametric SFHs)
using Hybrid Monte Carlo.

* Forward model many aspects of spectroscopic data analysis and
  calibration, including sky emission, spectrophotometric calibration,
  and wavelength solutions, thus proprly incorporating uncertainties
  in these components in the final  parameter uncertainties.
